        An H-R Diagram is a plot that displays temperature and luminosity
        information about stars. Luminosity (Y axis) is a measure of the total
        energy output from a star per unit of time. It’s commonly expressed as
        Solar luminosity, which is the ratio of a star’s energy output compared
        to the energy output of the Sun. For example, a star with a solar
        luminosity of 10 is giving off ten times more energy than the Sun. The
        temperature (X axis) is commonly measured in Kelvin.

        Notice that most data points occupy a region stretching diagonally from
        the upper left to the lower right of the plot. This region is called the
        main sequence. Stars in the main sequence are fusing hydrogen. The
        fusion pressure force is balanced against the force of gravity, which
        keeps the star in a stable state for most of its lifetime.

        The main sequence forms a slightly s-shaped diagonal band across the
        plot. Answer the following questions to determine the approximate
        position of the main sequence stars on this H-R Diagram. As you answer
        questions this region will be added to the H-R Diagram.
