        In the following sections you will locate the star cluster in an image,
        create an H-R Diagram from that star cluster, and then compare your
        results to an anstronomer&apos;s. You will do this twice, and then
        compare your observations of two star clusters.

        Note: Not all the stars you see in the image are actually stars in the
        clusterâ€”some are much closer to Earth than the stars in the cluster, and
        some are farther away. Because of their different distances, these stars
        can provide inaccurate information on an H-R Diagram if plotted with the
        stars in the cluster, so you should eliminate as many of these stars
        from your selection as possible.
