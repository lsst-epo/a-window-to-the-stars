          <p>
            In the following sections you will locate the star cluster in an
            image, create an H-R Diagram from that star cluster, and then
            compare your results to an anstronomer&apos;s. You will do this
            twice, and then compare your observations of two star clusters.
          </p>
          <p className="copy-secondary">
            Note: Not all the stars you see in the image are actually stars in
            the clusterâ€”some are much closer to Earth than the stars in the
            cluster, and some are farther away. Because of their different
            distances, these stars can provide inaccurate information on an H-R
            Diagram if plotted with the stars in the cluster, so you should
            eliminate as many of these stars from your selection as possible.
