        Stars spend about 90% of their lifetimes as main sequence stars. The
        main sequence mass of a star is used to calculate its main sequence
        lifetime. This lifetime is not the age of the star in years, it is a
        predicted time for how long the star will exist as a stable main
        sequence star with balanced forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lifetime of a star depends on two factors: how much hydrogen is
        available for nuclear fusion, and the rate at which fusion is
        proceeding. The cores of high mass stars experience a much greater
        gravitational force than the cores of low mass stars. As a result,
        temperature and fusion rates are much higher in the cores of high mass
        stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main sequence lifetime of a star can be estimated by this
        relationship:
